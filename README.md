# A Comparison of Computer Vision Approaches for Food-Image Classification

Repository containing .ipynb script for training and fine tuning 3 SOTA CNN models on Food 101 dataset.  

I present  an  approach  to classify food images using SOTA computer vision systems. I trained and fine-tuned InceptionV3 for the test set on the Food-101 dataset, leading to an overall test accuracy of 85%.

All required packages can be found within the code. I have also uploaded a detailed documentation of the experiments and results I conducted for this project.
