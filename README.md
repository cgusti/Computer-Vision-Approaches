# A Comparison of Computer Vision Approaches for Food-Image Classification

Repository containing .ipynb script for training and fine tuning InceptionV3 on Food 101 dataset.  

I present  an  approach  to classify food images using SOTA computer vision systems. The goal of this paper is to train and fine tune a deep learning SOTA CNN model with >85% accuracy for top-1 for the test set on the Food-101 dataset, leading to an overall test accuracy of 85%
